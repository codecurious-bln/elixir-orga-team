## Introduction

- had 2 meetings before
- very few people today: maybe not good decision power
- current state:
  - multiple proposals for workshops
  - Luca's proposal: nerves project
  - who to target: complete beginners vs. people at junior level in other programming languages
  - Kaja prepared survey
- results of survey:
  - target group?: do two separate workshops
  - how to organize the group?: stay as one big group (people could focus on single workshop)
  - pursue the nerves project?: difficult question... (it does not run on windows)
- How many people are interested in a workshop?
  - we don't have any numbers (there was a survey first)
  - up to us (Kaja said we won't have problems to fill the workshop - rather will have to send people away)
- If we start with one workshop, which one should it be?
  - Max: would start with the intermediate workshop because copy of Rails Girls workshop is not very helpful for absolute beginners

## Actual Meeting

- have some decisions:
  - some things may be very hard to decide based on the data
  - we still should make SOME decisions
- what can we even decide?
- decisions:
  - Must support windows for the beginners workshop?: YES
  - Do we not have to support windows for the intermediate workshop?: YES
    - Max: No, the people know about computers, we can inform them upfront plus have an installation party
    - Docker may also be an option
    - with coaches help, we could get everyone running
  - Should we stay as one group: YES
    - the survey says yes
  - We want to organize two workshops (beginner and intermediate): YES
  - Which workshop to start with? (beginner vs. intermediate): WE START BOTH
    - depends on how we progress on the topics
    - start with intermediate one could provide good learnings for a beginner workshop
    - people in intermediate workshop may be better with dealing with a not yet perfect workshop
    - we already have two "solutions" for the intermediate workshop
    - we could start both in parallel, the question is just when we "release"
    - scenic: Jens - the snake tutorial was great
  - What project for the intermediate workshop? Nerves, Scenic and Phoenix are in the game
    - Nerves back in the game (Luca)
    - Scenic will be pitched (Jens, Christoph)
    - Phoenix LiveView workshop (Markus, Angelika)
  - What project for the beginners workshop?: Mathias will a music CLI, Angelika & Markus would pitch Phoenix
    - Mathias: idea for a CLI app to make simple sounds (did not try on Windows yet)
    - a Phoenix project could also work for the beginner workshop
    - port the Rails Girls project to Phoenix

## Outcome

- we will meet again in two weeks
  - it's also possible to stream the meeting / join the meeting remotely if necessary
- people will present tutorials / ideas for Nerves, Phoenix and Scenic
- people will already share link to tutorials in Slack upfront so that others can try them / be prepared for discussing them
- based on the tutorials we'll start putting them into guides
