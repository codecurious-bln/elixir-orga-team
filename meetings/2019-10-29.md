# Code Curious Elixir Meeting 2019-10-29

## Attendees

- Jens (moderating)
- Nicolo
- Markus
- Max
- Tobi
- Gui

## Topics

- recap last TODOs
- decide on workshop and audience
- find date for workshop

## Organizational matters

- low attendance: check who's interested in coaching and organizing
  - people are sick
  - we are enough people to organize the workshop
  - once we know about the workshop: make call for coaches
- early Doodle and clear announcement helps for attendance
- the work on the guide is done via PRs (merge whenever it makes sense)

## Decide on workshop

### Which audience

- start with intermediate:
  - works best for first workshop
  - quick vote: we start with intermediate
- "intermediate" means confident with with computers
  - this of course includes juniors

### Which content

- recap:
  - nerves project (we stopped looking at it)
  - snake (people seem to like it)
  - elixir-girls chat app (only looked at it briefly)
    - we did not look into their intermediate guide
- round of votes:
  - snake fun and entertaining
  - snake lots of Elixir good to start
  - snake has visual aspects
  - snake tutorial has "natural steps" (works great for guide)
  - snake does not work for finding a job, but valid for tutorial
  - hardware project: makes sense for the future, but too much orga effort for now
  - elixir girls app: we would need to update the guide (no ETS, less JS)
    - pro: great for lots of elixir and no phoenix
    - pro: has lots of the language features in it
- decision: take the snake tutorial
- will proceed with other projects in future workshops then

#### What else do we need for the workshop?

- we have simplified the original tutorial
- split the tutorial into steps
- brief introduction into the language:
  - best as an interactive presentation (it should fit what we need for the game)
  - also a guide for what is what
- do we need the repo for people to clone it?
  - not necessary... but good as a solution
  - we'd prefer to have people start with an empty file
  - have repo with steps as a solution
- break the guide down into steps
  - every step relates to a visual change in the game
  - have code snippets and where to put them in the guide
  - code snippets are explained via guide plus coaches
  - include information for coaches in the guide (for people not familiar with scenic)
  - guide for participants and coaches in the same file (e.g. use HTML detail tag)
- start from the `scenic_new` scaffold
  - small steps
  - bigger chapters
  - start with Markdown on Github (can then also maybe be hosted on new Code Curious website)
- have group working for the guide
  - flash out basic chapter structure and one example chapter together
  - then work on different parts in parallel

### Which date

- beginning of February sounds like a plan
  - early February (Saturday 1st of February)
- we need 6 weeks for preparation

## Outcome

- **Nicolo** will set up Doodle for next meetup
- do an intermediate workshop with the snake tutorial
  - write tutorial for attendees setting up snake game from scratch (using `scenic_new`)
  - **Max, Nico and Markus** meet on Monday 4th to start with the guide (flash out structure, write first chapter)
- **Tobi** is doing a general intro guide to Elixir (what's necessary for the snake tutorial)
- **all** propose workshop date to Code Curious organizers
